# Cab-Fare-Prediction

# Tools Used:

 Python : The primary programming language used for data analysis and modeling.
 Pandas : For data manipulation and preprocessing.
 NumPy : For numerical operations on datasets.
 Matplotlib & Seaborn : For data visualization to understand patterns and trends.
 Scikit-learn : For implementing machine learning models such as Linear Regression,
Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting Regressor, etc.
 Jupyter Notebook : As the development environment for coding and documentation.

# Working Procedure:

 Data Loading and Exploration
Loaded the training and test datasets using pandas. Performed exploratory analysis to
understand the data structure, check for missing values, data types, and overall distributions.
 Data Preprocessing
Cleaned the dataset by removing rows with missing passenger counts. Converted
pickup_datetime into proper datetime format. Removed outliers in fare amounts and
coordinates. Calculated distance using the Haversine formula and extracted time-based
features like year, month, day, and hour.
 Feature Engineering
Created additional features such as trip distance and time-related attributes to help the model
capture spatial and temporal patterns.
 Model Development
Tried out multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor,
and Gradient Boosting Regressor. Trained them on the cleaned dataset and evaluated
performance using R² score.
 Evaluation and Optimization
Compared model performance on both training and test sets. Tuned hyperparameters and
worked to reduce overfitting or underfitting.
 Prediction
Made final predictions on the test set using the best model and prepared the file in the
required format.

# Learning Outcomes:
 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Learned how to clean and prepare real-world data, handle missing values, and engineer
features that improve model accuracy.
 Machine Learning Techniques
Gained hands-on experience with regression models and understood how ensemble methods
like Gradient Boosting improve results.
 Statistical Analysis
Improved skills in analyzing data trends and visualizing insights effectively.
 Project Management
Understood the end-to-end workflow of a data science project and became more confident
using tools like Jupyter Notebook for documentation and analysis.
